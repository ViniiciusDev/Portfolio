# 💻 My Personal Portfolio
This is a portfolio project developed to showcase my skills, completed projects, and contact information in a clear and elegant way. The main goal was to create a responsive and functional interface using only the core technologies of the web.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
The project was built "from scratch" using:

**HTML5:** For semantic content structuring.

**CSS3:** For all styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and animations.

**Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## 🛠️ How to View the Project
Since this is a static code project (HTML and CSS only), it does not require any installation of dependencies or compilers.
